# Online Payment Fraud Detection 🔍💳

## Overview
Online Payment Fraud Detection is a project designed to identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions in real-time. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project analyzes transaction data to distinguish between genuine and potentially fraudulent activities, offering valuable insights to improve security in online payment systems. This solution is especially relevant for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms looking to safeguard customer transactions.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses transaction data for accurate analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extracts key features from transaction data to enhance model accuracy.

Fraud Detection Models: Implements various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) for classifying transactions.

Real-Time Detection: Simulates real-time fraud detection for immediate response to suspicious activities.

Performance Evaluation: Analyzes model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Optional Integrations: Flask or FastAPI for API deployment
